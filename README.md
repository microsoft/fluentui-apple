## Getting Started
### Install and use FluentUI

#### Requirements

- iOS 11+ or macOS 10.14+
- Xcode 11+
- Swift 5.0+

#### Using Carthage

To integrate FluentUI using Carthage, specify it in your Cartfile:

```
github "Microsoft/fluentui-apple" ~> X.X.X
```

then follow the Carthage [integration steps](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application) to add the `FluentUI.framework` into your Xcode project

#### Using CocoaPods

To get set up with CocoaPods visit their [getting started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

To integrate FluentUI into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your Podfile:
```ruby
pod 'MicrosoftFluentUI', '~> X.X.X'
```

#### Manual installation

- Download the latest changes from the [FluentUI for Apple](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-apple) repository.
- Move the `fluentui-apple` folder into your project folder.
- Move the relevant `FluentUI.xcodeproj` into your Xcode project depending on which platform you want to support.
- In Xcode select your project -> your target -> General -> Embedded Binaries -> add `FluentUI.framework`.

#### Swift Package Manager
As of this writing, the version of Swift Package Manager shipped with the latest Xcode does not support packages that require resource bundles. As Fluent UI Apple does  require resource bundles, we do not currently support Swift Package Manager.

### Import and use FluentUI

After the framework has been added you can import the module to use it:

For Swift
```swift
import FluentUI
```
For Objective-C
```objective-c
#import <FluentUI/FluentUI.h>
```
