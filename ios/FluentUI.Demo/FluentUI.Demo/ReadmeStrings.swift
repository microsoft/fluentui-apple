    static let segmentedControlString: String? = "A segmented control lets someone select one option from a set of two or more segments in a single, horizontal container.\n\nSegmented controls work well for changing states of elements or views within a single context, like filtering search results. Itâ€™s best not to use them to initiate actions or navigate to a new page. To let people navigate between the main sections of an app, use the tab bar."

    static let dateTimePickerString: String? = "A date and time picker is a specialized interface that lets people choose a single date, a range of dates, or a time.\n\nDate and time pickers provide context that can help people make decisions, like the day of the week a date falls or unavailable dates. Avoid using date and time pickers for dates people know well or that will require a lot of scrolling, like birthdays."

    static let badgeString: String? = "A badge is a compact, interactive, textual representation of a person. It is generally a representation of user-input text that maps to an entry in a database."

    static let buttonString: String? = "A button triggers a single action or event.\n\nUse buttons for important actions like submitting a response, committing a change, or moving to the next step. If you need to navigate to another place, try a link instead."
