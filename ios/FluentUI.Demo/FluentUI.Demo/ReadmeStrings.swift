    static let segmentedControlString: String? = "A segmented control lets someone select one option from a set of two or more segments in a single, horizontal container.\n\nSegmented controls work well for changing states of elements or views within a single context, like filtering search results. Itâ€™s best not to use them to initiate actions or navigate to a new page; try a button or link instead. To let people navigate between the main sections of an app, use the tab bar."
