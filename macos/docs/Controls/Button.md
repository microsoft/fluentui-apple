# Button

## Overview
Buttons are one of the core controls that make an app feel native to the platform it's on. Itâ€™s important to respect the platform's paradigms in order to help the user feel at home on macOS and keep the experience quality high.

## Best Practices
### Do
- Make sure the label conveys a clear purpose of the button to the user.
- Describe the action the button will perform, ideally with a verb. Use concise, specific, self-explanatory labels, usually a single word.

### Don't
- Place the default focus on a button that performs a destructive actionn. Instead, place the default focus on the button that performs the "safe action" (e.g "Cancel").

## Usage
```Swift
// There are 3 styles to choose from, the default being primary filled
let primaryFilledButton = Button(title: "FluentUI Button", style: .primaryFilled),
let primaryOutlineButton = Button(title: "FluentUI Button", style: .primaryOutline),
let BorderlessButton = Button(title: "FluentUI Button", style: .borderless),
```

```Swift
// You can display an image instead of a title
let buttonWithImageAndStyle = Button(image: NSImage(named: NSImage.addTemplateName)!, style: .primaryFilled)
```
